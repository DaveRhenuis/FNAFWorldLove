# FNAFWorldLove
This is the repository of the fangame recreation of FNAF World using Love2D.

To run the game, download all the files from GitHub, then go to: https://love2d.org/ and download a version of Love2D (for the project, I used Love2D 11.5).

After downloading all the files, put the game files from FNAF World Love into one folder, then, to execute the game, just drag and drop the entire folder to the love.exe executable inside the Love2D folder.

Have fun modding the game!

The code is being provided 'as it is', with most of my original comments for the functions.

All of the code outside of the libraries folder was written by me (except conf.lua, wich is a template).

IF YOU TRY TO CREATE AN EXECUTABLE, CHECK IF ANY FILES HAVE UPPER CASE EXTENSIONS, BECAUSE LOVE IS CASE SENSITIVE.
